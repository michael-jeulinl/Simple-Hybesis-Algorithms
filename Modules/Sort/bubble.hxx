  /// Proceed an in-place bubble-sort on the elements.
  /// sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through
  /// the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong
  /// order.
  /// The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps needed: it indicates that the list is sorted.
  ///
  /// @complexity O(N²) in average case and O(N²) on worst case.
  /// @remark: Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problem.
  ///
  /// @tparam IT type using to go through the collection.
  /// @tparam Compare functor type (std::less_equal in order, std::greater_equal for inverse order).
  ///
  /// @param begin,end iterators to the initial and final positions of
  /// the sequence to be sorted. The range used is [first,last), which contains all the elements between
  /// first and last, including the element pointed by first but not the element pointed by last.
