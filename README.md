# CMake - Cross-Building
The building relies on CMake, an Open-Source system that allows to easily build cross-platform applications by generating native makefiles (cf. http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).

# Getting Started
## Build using CMake-GUI:

    Run CMake-GUI
    Select source/target directory
    Click on Configure the project
    Click on Generate the Solution files
    Open the solution file (if MSVC) and build or use make command.

## Build in Command-Line (UNIX):

    mkdir Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build (Create Build directory)
    cd Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build    (Open build director)
    ccmake ../Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms   (Configure the make given Source repository)
    make                                  (Make command, use -j parameter to use multi-core)

# Doxygen Documentation & CMake
Use the CMake **'BUILD_DOC'** (default to true) option to automatically setup Documentation Generation with doxygen.

Please find the last generated documentation here:
http://michaeljeulin-l.com/Projects/SHAC/Doc/

# GTest - Unit Testing & CMake
Use the CMake **'BUILD_TESTING'** (default to true) option to automatically setup Unit Testing with google test.
It allows to very quickly get set up with C++ and google test:

- Clone GTest via GIT
- Setup the Unit Testings
- Compile GTest at build time

Use the CMake **'WITH_COVERAGE'** (default to true) option to automatically setup Coverage Generation.
The minimal requiered coverage is **95%**.

Please find the last testing dashboard here:
http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Simple-Hybesis-Algorithm

## Running Unit Tests (UTs)
You can whether use CTest or manually run the unit tests.

E.g. to manually run the 'TestBasicBinary' Unit Test (using GTest):

    Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build/Modules/Search/Testing/Debug/TestBinary.exe  (Win)
    ./Simple-Hybesis-Algorithms-Build/Modules/Search/Testing/Debug/TestBinary    (UNIX)

# Current Algorithms - Data Structures
#### Combinatory
- **Combinations:** Compute all possible combinations of elements containing within the sequence.
- **Intersection:** Compute the intersection of two sequences keeping duplicate keys distinct.
- **IsInterleaved:** Determine whether or not a sequence is the interleave of the two others.
- **Permutations:** Compute all possible permutations of elements containing within the sequence.

#### Data Structures
- **BinarySearchTree:** Binary Search Tree, Ordered Tree or Sorted Binary Tree divides all its sub-trees into two segments: left sub-tree and right sub-tree.

#### Search
- **Binary Search:** Iteratively proceed a dichotomous search, within a sorted sequence, on the first occurrence of the key.
- **Kth Smallest / Biggest element - Order Statitstics:** Find the kth smallest/biggest element.
- **Maximal/Minimal Distance:** Identify the two elements of the sequence that give the maximal/minimal distance.
- **Maximal/Minimal M Elements:** Retrieve the m maximal/minimal values sorted in respectively decreasing increasing order.
- **Maximal/Minimal Sub-Sequence:** Identify the sub-sequence with the maximum/minimum sum. One of the problem resolved by this algorithm is:
"Given an array of gains/losses over time, find the period that represents the best/worst cumulative gain."

#### Sort
- **Bubble Sort:** Sometimes referred to as sinking sort: proceed an in-place bubble-sort on the elements.
- **Cocktail Sort:** Variation of bubble sort. Optimize a bubble sort bubbling in both directions on each pass.
- **Comb Sort:** Variation of bubble sort. The inner loop of bubble sort, which does the actual swap,
is modified such that gap between swapped elements goes down (for each iteration of outer loop) in steps of a "shrink factor" k: [ n/k, n/k2, n/k3, ..., 1 ].
- **MergeInplace:** Functor that proceeds a in place merge of two sequences of elements.
- **MergeSort:** John von Neumann in 1945: Proceed merge-sort on the elements whether using an in-place strategy or using a buffer.
- **MergeWithBuffer:** Functor that proceeds a merge of two sequences of elements using a buffer to improve time computation.
- **Partition-Exchange:** Proceed an in-place partitioning on the elements.
- **Quick Sort - Partition-Exchange Sort:** Proceed an in-place quick-sort on the elements.
- **Raddix Sort - LSD:** Proceed the Least Significant Digit Raddix sort, a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
